I mainly code in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, and I’ve worked with frameworks like <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>ASP.NET</strong>. Whether it’s creating RESTful APIs, building inventory systems 📦, integrating Google Maps 🗺️, or writing handy little scripts 🛠️ to make life easier, I love bringing ideas to life.</p><p>I'm always curious and eager to learn 📚 — new tech, tools, or tricks? Count me in! Right now, I’m looking for a <strong>full-time developer role</strong> where I can grow, collaborate, and keep leveling up 🚀.</p><p>I may be a little shy 🙈, but I’m super dedicated to my work. I aim to deliver top-notch results ✅ while keeping things positive and friendly with my teammates 🤝.</p><p>Outside of coding, I’m a big <strong>anime lover</strong> 🎌 (you’ll definitely catch me at conventions!), a casual <strong>gamer</strong> 🎮, and lately I’ve been diving into <strong>photography</strong> 📷. Oh — and I have a soft spot for <strong>cute things</strong> 🐾💖 (expect some adorable backgrounds or desk accessories around here 🐱✨).",
